# Ride My Way
Ride My Way app App is a social carpooling application that provides a platform for everyday people going to and from their place of work or business a way to share their ride. Too many people go to work alone in a 4 seater vehicle everyday which is a scenario than can be improved. Ride sharing apps like Uber exist but they are more taxi hailing applications than ride sharing applications. Ride my way provides the solution to tihs problem by allowing people to share their rides with people in the same organization as they are in within the app.

The core features are:

    Users can create an account and log in.
    Drivers can add ride offers.
    Passengers can view all available ride offers from drivers who are their friends.
    Passengers can see the details of a ride offer and request to join the ride. E.g What time the ride leaves, where it is headed e.t.c
    Drivers can view the requests to the ride offer they created.
    Drivers can either accept or reject a ride request.
